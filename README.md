# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for telecom and e-commerce companies using data-driven techniques. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models, we aim to identify customers likely to stop using a service, helping businesses take proactive retention steps.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior and identify patterns
- Predict churn using classification models
- Provide insights for improving customer retention

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Verified data types  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn rates by demographics, services used, and customer behavior  
   - Identified correlations and trends

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Normalized numeric features  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest models  
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

5. **Result Interpretation**  
   - Identified top features influencing churn  
   - Suggested business actions based on model output

## 🔍 Sample Output

Include screenshots here of:
- Churn distribution plots  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Model performance metrics  

## 🚀 Outcome

- Achieved **93% accuracy** in predicting churn (update with actual value)
- Highlighted key factors influencing churn
- Enabled data-backed decision making for customer retention

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a synthetic or open-source telecom churn dataset. (Uploaded)
